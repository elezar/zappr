## Zappr: Enhance your GitHub pull-request workflow

Zappr is a GitHub integration built to enhance your project workflow. Built by open-source enthusiasts,
it's aimed at helping developers to increase productivity and improve open-source project quality.
It does this primarily by removing bottlenecks around pull request approval and helping project owners to
halt "rogue" pull requests before they're merged into the master branch.

Zappr Features:

- you can apply it and enable/disable approval checks per repository, with the simple flip of a toggle
- you can configure what counts an approval and what doesn’t
- via a text-based user configuration file that you insert in your repository,
  you can override GitHub's default settings and endow users with PR approval authorization
  by inviting them by name, organization and/or contributor status.

### Why We Developed Zappr

#### Code Review

Zappr is our attempt to restore and improve code review to the process of developing a project on GitHub.
GitHub doesn’t impose restrictions on project contributions. While great for openness, this can pose challenges
for project developers who want contributors to follow certain guidelines. This challenge is noted in the
"[Dear GitHub](https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github)" letter that went viral in 2015.

#### Compliance

We are proponents of being able to do as much work as possible in GitHub, using GitHub. When working with
compliance requirements, howevr, this can get tricky: how can devs employ the four-eyes principle in GitHub?
Zappr aims to address this by applying a review/approval function to project workflow at a critical point of transition.

#### No More Bottlenecks

We think it could be very useful for larger open-source projects that can't rely on a handful of admins to
handle all PRs without sacrificing quality control.

### Technical Requirements

This is easy: All you need is a GitHub username. No setup is required. To start using Zappr on a specific project,
you *do* have to opt-in as a project/repo owner. Then you're set.

### Setup and Running Zappr

1. Using your GitHub account, log in to Zappr [here](https://zappr.opensource.zalan.do/login).
2. Authorize the application and type in your password to export your
[GitHub credentials](https://github.com/settings/applications).
3. You'll see a dashboard with all of your repositories listed in a column at left.
   Scroll all the way down to the bottom of this column and click the blue "Sync with GitHub button."
   (You will only need to do this whenever you add new repositories to your GitHub account.)
4. To enable Zappr on a specific repository, use the search function.
   You'll get a screen like this: [include screenshot]
5. Switch the toggle to "On": [screenshot]
6. At this time, you can customize your configuration by adding a zappr.yml file to your repository.

### Development

Export your [Github credentials](https://github.com/settings/applications):

```
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
```

**Build and Run:**

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

**Debug Client and Server:**

```
npm run build-client -- -d
npm run build-server -- -d
npm run run-all
```

Enable debug logs...

...in the terminal:

```
export DEBUG="zappr:*"
```

...in the browser console:

```
window.DEBUG.enable('zappr:*')
```

**Test:**

* `npm test` - run combined tests
* `npm run test-client` - run only client tests
* `npm run test-server` - run only server tests
* `npm run test-karma` - run Karma (UI) tests

**Docker Image:**

```
./tools/build.sh
```
